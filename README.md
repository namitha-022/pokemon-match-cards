# pokemon-match-cards
Created a Pokémon Match Cards game where players flip cards to find matching Pokémon pairs. It combines memory-testing gameplay with fun visuals of different Pokémon characters. I designed the game logic to handle card flipping, match-checking, and score tracking, while also focusing on keeping the interface simple and engaging.
